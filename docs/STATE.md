# Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-06-10 — Sprint 13 (reporter) shipped. **P3 exit criterion met.**

**How to read:** *Now* = being worked on. *Next* = queued, not started. *Parked* =
exists but inactive. *Shipped* = landed. Update at every transition.

---

## Now

**Sprint 14 — Dispatcher (P4 begins).** Implement `orchestration/Dispatcher` — replaces manual
in-test sequencing with `execute_run(trigger)` driving all 7 agents via the bus in order.
P4 exit contribution: `test_p4_celery_parity` proves the daily loop on `CeleryBus` (eager mode).

Branch: `sprint-14-dispatcher` · Plan: `docs/sprints/sprint-14-dispatcher.md`

Quality gate baseline (from `sprint-13-reporter`): 185 tests (+3 skipped) at 100% (floor 100.00).

Near-limit: `agents/monitor/agent.py` (197), `agents/monitor/tests/test_monitor_agent.py` (198) — split on next monitor touch.

## Next

- **Sprint 15 — Scheduler + supervisor message lineage** (P4 continuation): wall-clock trigger,
  minimal supervisor (`report_fault` + `Message` node lineage), full P4 exit criterion met.
- Build-when-needed: MCP tool-binding, RAG vector index.

## Workflow

The planning agent (expensive) writes sprint handovers and maintains documentation
and progress; a coding agent (cheap) implements one active sprint at a time on its
own branch and hands back. See `docs/sprints/README.md`.

## Shipped

- **Sprint 13 — Reporter agent** (P3 — **exit criterion met**). Read-only graph traversal
  produces `RunSnapshot` (portfolio/signal metrics, headline) and `TradeNarrative` (scan-to-exit
  story per position). `Snapshot -[:SUMMARISES]-> PMRun` and `TradeNarrative -[:NARRATES]->
  Position` written. `agent.py` 88 lines. 185 tests, floor 100.
- **Sprint 12 — Monitor agent** (P3). Opens positions from fills (`PMRun → OrderIntent → Fill`
  traversal), evaluates stop/target/time exit rules (integer PCT_SCALE arithmetic), drives
  `execution.execute_close` on the bus, writes `CloseDecision -[:CLOSES]-> Position` and
  `Fill -[:OPENS]-> Position` lineage. 6-agent pipeline test proves the complete P3 provenance
  chain. `MonitorRun` added to `contracts/monitor.py` `owns_graph`. 171 tests, floor 100.
- **Sprint 11 — Execution agent** (P3). Idempotent `PaperBroker` (dedupes by
  `f"{run_id}:{ticker}:{side}"`), four capabilities, `Fill -[:EXECUTES]-> OrderIntent` lineage.
  No `ExecRun` parent — fills keyed directly by idempotency key. 100% coverage.
- **Sprint 10 — Audit-truth & rigor hardening** (P3). Durable PM rejection evidence (`Rejection`
  nodes + lineage); contract value validators; deep-frozen graph props; matched InMemory/Neo4j
  edge identity (parity test); lazily-installed Neo4j uniqueness constraints; split the tight
  kernel modules; Stooq/MA/tie-break fixes. 144 tests; floor de-pinned 100 → 99.5.
- **Sprint 09 — Portfolio manager** (P3 begun). Sizes + risk-checks recommendations into
  `OrderIntent`s (two provider bus calls, deterministic sizing, explainable rejections, money as
  integer cents); `OrderIntent -[:APPROVES]-> Recommendation` lineage; 4-agent pipeline test green.
  130 tests, floor 100. *Audit-truth follow-ups (persist rejections, contract validators) go to
  the hardening sprint.*
- **Sprint 08 — Observability metrics adapter** (P1). Vendor-neutral `Metrics` protocol
  (`NullMetrics` default + `PrometheusMetrics` private-registry backend, no server); both buses
  instrumented for throughput/latency/outcome; `MeteredFaultSink` for fault-rate by source.
  112 tests, floor 99.75.
- **Sprint 07 — Distributed (Celery) bus** (P1). `CeleryBus` implementing `MessageBus` with
  `InProcessBus`-identical semantics (the four behaviours), tested in eager mode; a
  both-backends parity test proves the P1 bus exit; real-broker round-trip integration-marked.
  108 tests, floor 99.74.
- **Sprint 06 — Analyst agent** (P2 — **slice complete**). `analyze` +
  `explain_recommendation`; two provider bus calls (market data + regime), technical scoring,
  confidence gating by `base_min_confidence`, explainable rejections, and `Recommendation
  -DERIVED_FROM-> Candidate` lineage. The full-slice integration test proves the P2-exit
  chain `Recommendation → Candidate → ScanRun → MarketSnapshot`. 101 tests, floor 99.72.
- **Sprint 05 — Scanner agent** (P2). First agent-to-agent call: `run_scan` +
  `explain_filter` request `get_market_data` from `provider` over the bus (no import),
  deterministic filters/ranking with justified tunables, honest degraded handling, and
  cross-agent provenance (`Candidate → ScanRun → MarketSnapshot`). 87 tests, floor 99.67.
- **Sprint 04 — Provider agent** (P2, first agent). `provider` over the in-process bus:
  `get_market_data` + `get_regime`, `DataSource` port (`FakeDataSource` for the gate,
  keyless `StooqDataSource` network-gated), DI-1 integrity gate + VIX regime classifier
  (justified tunables), append-only provenance to the `GraphStore`, secrets `repr=False`.
  Established the agent-composition pattern; `agents` added to coverage. 79 tests, floor 99.6.
- **Sprint 03 — Neo4j GraphStore** (P1, partial). Kernel `GraphStore` protocol +
  `InMemoryGraphStore` + `Neo4jGraphStore` (fake-driver unit tests; live test skips without
  `NEO4J_TEST_URI`); append-only enforced (no prop overwrite), Cypher-injection guarded.
  Retired the relational adapter + Alembic; boundary map → single-writer-per-label. 67
  tests, floor raised to 99.5.
- **Sprint 02 — Relational persistence adapter** (P1, partial; **superseded by
  [ADR-0001](decisions/0001-neo4j-primary-store.md)** — relational store dropped for
  Neo4j). Domain-pure SQLAlchemy 2.0 `Base` + `PersistenceSettings` + a fault-wrapped
  `Database.session()`, plus an Alembic harness; 64 tests; `.env.example` now tracked.
- **Sprint 01 — Kernel runtime spine** (P1, partial). In-process bus + contract-
  bound `AgentBase` with inbound/outbound payload validation and the fault
  channel wired end-to-end; four behaviours covered (round-trip, inbound
  validation, handler raise, unknown capability). 58 tests, floor 99.1.
- **P0 — Boundary map + foundations.** 12 agent contracts + missions, kernel
  descriptors, config governance, central fault channel, the curator agent,
  self-enforcing guards, CI parity. First private push to GitHub.
