# Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-07-04 14:40 AEST · **Version:** 0.52.00 · **`make ci` + GHCR image build green on `main`.**

**How to read.** *Now* = active · *Next* = queued · *Recent* = last few shipped (older detail lives in
each `docs/sprints/sprint-NN-*.md` + `STATE-01/02/03.md` + git). **LAW-02:** an item is "shipped" only when
its success factors are *proven* (tests, `make ci`, the named live check) — never restate intent as outcome.

## Current focus

Since P14 the project runs as **etalon-first continuous improvement** (DL-19). Two active arcs (DL-35
reverses the etalon pause for the fleet workstream only):

- **Fleet-serve transport (DL-35)** — give the control-plane agents a real serve/consume path so the
  distributed fleet can run. **S97–S99 shipped — zero `idle_loop()` remains; the in-process fleet is
  functionally complete.** S100–S103 remain (Service Bus receiver is next; refresh its pre-S104 draft first).
- **Credential-security + bounded self-healing (DL-36) — ARC COMPLETE.** The master tests every
  credential before handover; failure → refuse + `Escalation` → LLM plans a bounded remediation →
  eval-gated auto-execute (one shot) → human. **A/B/C/D shipped (S104/S105/S106/S107)**; **S108** seeds
  Key Vault tested-before-insert (fail-closed) — the credential lifecycle is now closed at the source.

Layer-3 acceptance is 🟩 at the full S&P-500 (proven live 2026-06-26). The trade spine runs graph-pull
(DL-08). The fleet does **not** run distributed yet (S99–S103).

## Recent (most recent first — detail in each sprint doc)

- **S109 (ADR-0010, 0.51.00→0.52.00)** — heterogeneous deliberation: GPT-5.5 debaters + a separate **Opus**
  debate judge (`DELIBERATION_JUDGE_*` env); veto now debates a **grounded** proposition (fixes S96).
  `make ci` 100%. **⚠ Functional via a temporary gpt-5 judge; real-Opus check + golden re-freeze DEFERRED
  (billing, operator-accepted) — re-run Sun 2026-07-05.** Merged `81c3922`.
- **S99 (fleet arc, 0.50.00→0.51.00)** — forecaster/curator/researcher served over `serve_loop` (S98
  pattern); `idle_loop` deleted from `kernel/bootstrap.py` + guard test; clause-cited serving tests
  (`FORE-TRG-02` etc.). Codex-built, reviewed, `make ci` 100% + live Aura check (durable artifacts from a
  separate connection; trade spine untouched; 35 nodes torn down to 0). **In-process fleet functionally
  complete.** Merged `f68457b`.
- **S108 (DL-36 family, 0.49.00→0.50.00)** — `.env`→Key Vault seeder, **tested-before-insert**: a secret
  enters the vault only after a live working-check passes; failing/empty/unverifiable creds are rejected
  (fail-closed), dry-run by default. Also fixed a latent secret-map bug (provider Alpaca-secret env var).
  Codex-built, reviewed, `make ci` 100% + **live check** on vault `trading-agents-kv`. Merged `bfd7cf8`.
- **S107 (DL-36 D, 0.47.00→0.49.00)** — eval-gated auto-remediation execution: DSPy behind ADR-0010's
  `PromptOptimizer` port gates the selector; safe executors run the `test→execute→production→documentation`
  loop (one automatic shot then human); + thread-safe activation IDs + composition-root wiring. Codex-built,
  reviewed, `make ci` 100% + **live GPT-5.5** check on Aura (selector 5/5, gate trips, refetch heals). Merged `f980965`.
- **S106 (DL-36 C, 0.47.00)** — bounded-catalogue LLM remediation planner (enum guardrail, fail-open,
  configurable `auto_remediation_scope`); plans + gates, never executes. Live GPT-5.5 check. Merged `8f74bfa`.

## Now

On `main`, no active sprint branch. The etalon north-star holds (DL-19): remaining gray law clauses →
green with cited tests; **every sprint ends with a real-environment functionality check**
(`docs/laws/functionality-checks.md`) + teardown. Each sprint/chore on its own `sprint-NN-<slug>` branch;
merge to `main` is the deploy trigger (rebuilds + pushes agent images). Coding may be done here or handed
to Codex via a self-contained sprint file (proven on S106).

## Next

- **S110 signal evaluation battery (qlib Q1b) — code complete on branch, LIVE CHECK PENDING.** PROVEN:
  branch `sprint-110-signal-evaluation-battery` (`1777352`), `make ci` green — 1294 passed, 100.00 %
  coverage, 0.53.00 bumped. **NOT proven:** the real-data check — blocked by **DL-37** (reference
  Postgres decommissioned; host unresolvable + zero PG servers in all subscriptions, verified
  2026-07-04). Check re-scoped to a **Tiingo** export (sprint doc amended); coding agent correctly
  refused to fabricate evidence. Remaining: Tiingo export → retrain booster → run battery → record
  `functionality-checks.md` row → then merge. Revised qlib phasing: Q1b → Q1c → Q3 (self-built
  walk-forward) → Q5 (governed factor mining).
- **S109 re-run (pending Anthropic billing)** — re-freeze `deliberation_golden.json` with the real **Opus**
  judge + run the live-Opus check; until then the drift-firewall baseline is pre-Opus. Sun 2026-07-05 reminder set.
- **Remaining DL-36 hardening** — destructive executors (`rotate-credential`/`recreate-instance`) stay
  human-manual until an Azure/Aura write path + rollback + approval UI land; the diskcache CVE from the
  offline DSPy extra → hardening-backlog (not in runtime/images).
- **Fleet arc S100–S103** — **S100 Service Bus receiver: handover Codex-ready + namespace `trading-agents-bus`
  provisioned & live-verified (`infra/servicebus.bicep`); unblocked to build** (implement the receive half of
  `bus_azure.py` behind the `RequestConsumer` protocol) · permanent Neo4j (S101) · 13-container run-through +
  distributed acceptance (S102) · dispatcher cron (S103). Refresh the S101–103 pre-S104 drafts before executing.
- **Deferred behind a perfect etalon (DL-19):** CI-1..CI-6 (ADR-0013, S90–S95) · the bundle **generator** ·
  ADR-0010 reusable predictor registry/promotion (first instance landed in S107) · P12 scorecard-run (needs
  a live news runway) · P13 cross-asset graph · `contracts/` substrate/pack split.
