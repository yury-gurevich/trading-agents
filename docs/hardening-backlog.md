# Hardening backlog

Cross-cutting supply-chain, security, and code-quality improvements that are **deferred but not
dropped**. Each item names its **unblock trigger** — the event after which it should be picked up —
so it resurfaces at the right time instead of being forgotten. Reviewed whenever a trigger fires or
at sprint boundaries; referenced from `docs/STATE.md` Pointers.

## Done

- **A — least-privilege workflow token** (`permissions: contents: read` in `ci.yml`). Shipped
  2026-06-18 (`chore/dependabot-and-hygiene`).
- **B — GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs** (Dependabot `github-actions` ecosystem keeps them
  fresh). Shipped 2026-06-18.
- **Weekly Dependabot** (uv / github-actions / docker). Shipped 2026-06-18.
- **Dependabot auto-merge** (`.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`): non-major dependency PRs
  auto-approve + auto-merge once the required CI checks pass; branch protection on `main` requires
  `quality` + `test` + `security`. Majors stay open for review; docker `python` majors are ignored
  (codebase targets 3.13). Shipped 2026-06-18 (`chore/dependabot-automerge`).
- **C — CodeQL SAST** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml` plus the CI security lane with
  `GHAS_ENABLED=true`). Enforcing since 2026-07-04; S127 proved zero open error-level findings and
  the security lane remains required alongside `pip-audit` and `detect-secrets`. Evidence:
  [S129 GitHub hardening proof](reports/sprint-129-fixpack/live-proof.md#3-github-hardening-proof).
- **D — dependency review on PRs** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Shipped in S129 with
  `actions/dependency-review-action` pinned to `2031cfc080254a8a887f58cffee85186f0e49e48`
  (`v4.9.0`), failing moderate-or-higher vulnerable additions and the explicit denied package
  `pkg:pypi/pycrypto`. Evidence:
  [S129 GitHub hardening proof](reports/sprint-129-fixpack/live-proof.md#3-github-hardening-proof).
- **E — container image scanning** (`.github/workflows/build-images.yml`). Shipped in S129 with
  Trivy pinned to `ed142fd0673e97e23eac54620cfb913e5ce36c25` (`v0.36.0`), gating HIGH/CRITICAL
  OS/library findings on representative images for the runtime-only, runtime+Azure, and
  forecaster dependency-layer families (`analyst`, `master`, `forecaster`). Accepted findings must
  be documented in `.trivyignore` with sprint/design-log evidence, scope, owner, and expiry.
  Evidence:
  [S129 GitHub hardening proof](reports/sprint-129-fixpack/live-proof.md#3-github-hardening-proof).
- **F — build + push deploy pipeline** (`.github/workflows/build-images.yml` +
  `scripts/record_deploy.py`). The real shipped shape builds and pushes all 14 images to GHCR on
  `main` and manual dispatch, then records deploy currency through the DL-46 `DeployRecord` flow.
  ADR-0007 still names DockerHub; DL-50 surfaces the GHCR drift and queues a formal ADR amendment
  instead of silently rewriting the accepted ADR. Evidence:
  [S129 GitHub hardening proof](reports/sprint-129-fixpack/live-proof.md#3-github-hardening-proof).
- **G — mutation testing (`mutmut`)**. Shipped in S132 as a manual periodic exercise, not a CI
  gate. The scoped decision-engine run improved from 5,282/6,731 killed (78.47%) to 5,376/6,731
  killed (79.87%); the remaining 1,355 survivor/no-test rows are documented-equivalent in the
  report. Re-run after a stable sprint or when decision-engine gate logic changes. Evidence:
  [S132 mutation testing report](reports/sprint-132-mutation-testing/README.md).
- **H — base-image CVE remediation** (`agents/*/Dockerfile`, `orchestration/Dockerfile`, and
  `.github/workflows/build-images.yml`). Shipped in S130: Trivy now ignores unfixed findings while
  still failing fixed HIGH/CRITICAL OS/library findings, `.trivyignore` remains empty, and all 14
  images use two-stage `dhi.io/python:3.13-dev` -> `dhi.io/python:3.13` builds with venv-carrying
  runtimes. Manual `build-images` run `29681635979` built/pushed all 14 `s130-test` images and
  passed every Trivy gate; the actionable finding count dropped from S129's representative `22` to
  `0` gate-blocking findings. Evidence:
  [S130 base-image live proof](reports/sprint-130-base-image/live-proof.md#final-live-run).
- **J — dispatcher image carries only its measured runtime slice.** Shipped in S131:
  `scripts/dispatch_scheduled_run.py` was measured at a 43-file calendar-skip closure and a
  44-file fake-trading-day closure; `orchestration/Dockerfile` now copies `kernel/`,
  `contracts/`, the scheduled-dispatch orchestration files, the two needed agent modules
  (`agents/provider/domain/market_calendar.py`, `agents/scanner/universe.py`), and the
  dispatcher script/universe file instead of wholesale `agents/`, `orchestration/`, and
  `scripts/`. Evidence:
  [S131 blast-radius proof](reports/sprint-131-blast-radius/live-proof.md#row-j-dispatcher-image).

## Open — with unblock triggers

| ID | Item | Why | Unblock trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **I** | Per-agent Service Bus SAS scoping (part 2) | S131 completed part 1: the Postgres blast radius is split into 15 `ta_<name>` identities with identical graph grants, role-specific Key Vault secret names, and Container Apps secret-backed `POSTGRES_DSN` delivery. The remaining shared credential is the Azure Service Bus connection string, so one compromised container can still use the whole bus. | Next security-focused sprint (**packaged as S133**): create per-topic authorization rules + per-agent Service Bus SAS connection strings, then wire them with the same secret-backed per-target delivery pattern. |
| **K** | Assertion-strength gap in the broker/adapter/audit I/O layers (surfaced by S132 mutation) | S132's scoped mutmut run left **177 `no tests` mutants** (and part of the 1,178 `survived`) in real-money I/O code — `agents/execution/alpaca.py` broker methods, adapter envelopes, audit serialization. These are **line-covered** (the 100 % floor forces it) but **assertion-weak**: no test kills the mutant. The S132 report bucketed them as `documented-equivalent/*`, but the honest reading is *un-asserted*, not *semantically unkillable* — the CSV notes disclose this per row. Value: mutation found where the suite executes I/O code without checking its behavior. | Incremental — strengthen assertions on the highest-value bucket first (broker boundary `agents/execution/alpaca.py`), re-run the S132 mutmut scope, watch the `no tests`/`survived` count fall. Not a full sprint; fold into the next execution-agent touch or a rainy-day rigor pass. Evidence: [S132 report](reports/sprint-132-mutation-testing/README.md) + `actionable-mutants.csv`. |

## Branch protection recommendations (with CodeQL)

When GHAS is enabled and `jobs.security.env.GHAS_ENABLED` is `"true"`:

1. Require these checks on `main`: `quality`, `test`, `security`.
2. Keep `security` required because it now contains `pip-audit`, `detect-secrets`, and conditional CodeQL analysis.
3. Keep Dependabot non-major auto-merge enabled; majors remain manual.
4. Keep "dismiss stale approvals" enabled to force re-review after dependency drift.

## How this list stays alive

1. **Trigger-coupling** (primary): landed items move to **Done** with code/workflow evidence; registry
   or supply-chain design drift is surfaced in the design log before any ADR amendment.
2. **STATE.md pointer**: this file is linked from `docs/STATE.md` Pointers, read every session.
3. **Optional**: mirror D–G as GitHub issues with a `hardening` label if/when issue-tracking is
   adopted (the repo has a GitHub remote). Not required while this doc is the single source.
